Aims of the Project

To quantify bias–variance behaviour in tree-based models

To compare variance reduction (Random Forest) vs. bias reduction (Gradient Boosting)

To visualise decision boundaries that reveal model smoothness and complexity

To demonstrate how ensemble strategies alter model generalisation pathways

Dataset

A synthetic two-class "moons" dataset with added Gaussian noise is used.
This dataset offers a clear, interpretable structure, enabling precise visual and statistical analysis of model behaviour.

Reproducibility Notes

All results presented in the report can be reproduced by opening the notebook and executing it from start to finish.
The notebook automatically generates all figures and stores them inside the bv_figs/ directory.

Accessibility Statement

High-contrast colour-blind-safe palettes are used throughout

Alt-text descriptions are included with every figure in the report

Section headings follow a consistent hierarchy for screen-reader navigation

All explanations are structured to support clarity and readability
